# Umbraco Block Grid Demo Site
This repo contains the demo site and material from my Umbraco Block Grid talks in UK and DK November 2022.

The site is built on Umbraco 11 RC5, which means you need .NET 7 to run it. 

The site DB is included in this repo, so you should be able to "just" clone the repo and run the site. 

The credentials for the backoffice are:

- Email: admin@localhost
- Password: SuperSecret123

...these are also displayed on the login screen :smile:

:warning: :warning: When trying this out, please keep in mind that the block HTML and CSS is written by a back-end developer. It is by no means perfect - for one it doesn't scale very gracefully to smaller screens. :warning: :warning: 

Have fun!
